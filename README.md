## üìÉ Repositories
- [RecRoom Long Username Exploit](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/RecRoom-Username-Exploit) No longer being worked on as it does not need any updates. If this does break I'll update it for the third time.
- [Space Bars In Discord Channel Names](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/Space-Bars-In-Discord-Channel-Names) No longer being worked on as it will work for ever.
- [RecRoom 2025 Prefab List](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/RecRoom-Prefabs-2025) No longer being worked on as all prefabs are currently working.
- [RecRoom Cleaner](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/RecRoom-Spoofer) No longer being worked on. Use Insanity's RR cleaner instead.
- [Windows FPS And Ping Fixer](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/Windows-FPS-And-Ping-Fixer) Being fixed and then ported to System X.
- [C++ HWID Checker](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/CPlusPlus-HWID-Checker) No longer being worked on, was something I made for another project but decided to split the source code up so other people can use this code in there projects.
- [Batch HWID Checker](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/Batch-HWID-Checker) No longer being worked on. I made it after Microsoft removed wmic commands from Batch so people can check there HWID's in Batch.
- [RecRoom Insanity Cheat](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/Insanity) No longer being worked on. Code related to exploits has been removed and notes have been added so you get a better understanding of the code. I stopped working on Insanity because Visual Sutdio corrupted some of the main code and other stuff so the source code is a version before then.
- [System X](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/SystemX) Currently being worked on (new update soon)
- [Mocha/Latte Source Code Leak](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/rr-mocha-latte-source-leak) Yeah... I ain't updating this, you all can use this how ever you want.
## üç¥ Forks
- [Discord Server Generater](https://github.com/AlwaysAError/Fork-Of-bytexenon)
